# Advanced API Exercises

These exercises challenge you to build complete applications, handle complex scenarios, and implement best practices for API integration.

---

## Exercise 1: Multi-API Integration

**Objective:** Combine multiple APIs in a single application.

**Task:** Build a "Daily Brief" script that uses both APIs.

**Instructions:**
Create a script that:

1. Gets a dad joke for the day
2. Creates a deck and draws a "card of the day"  
3. Formats everything nicely
4. Saves results with timestamp

**Sample Output:**

```bash
=== Daily Brief - 2023-10-12 ===
Joke of the Day: "Why don't scientists trust atoms? Because they make up everything!"
Card of the Day: King of Hearts
Generated at: 2023-10-12 15:30:45
```

## Exercise 2: Error Recovery and Retry Logic

**Objective:** Implement robust error handling for production use.

**Task:** Build a deck manager with automatic retry and recovery.

**Features to implement:**

- Retry failed requests with exponential backoff
- Detect and handle expired deck IDs
- Gracefully handle network failures
- Log all operations and errors

---

## Exercise 3: Configuration-Driven API Client

**Objective:** Build a flexible, reusable API client.

**Task:** Create a script that reads API configurations from YAML/JSON files.

**Requirements:**

- Support multiple APIs with different auth methods
- Configurable endpoints and parameters
- Template-based output formatting
- Environment-specific configurations

---

## Exercise 4: Performance Benchmarking

**Objective:** Analyze and optimize API performance.

**Task:** Build a benchmarking tool that:

- Measures response times for different request patterns
- Tests concurrent vs. sequential requests
- Analyzes throughput and latency
- Generates performance reports

---

## Exercise 5: Real-time Card Game

**Objective:** Build an interactive card game with live API integration.

**Task:** Create a complete Blackjack game with:

- Interactive player input
- Real-time deck management
- Score tracking
- Game state persistence
- Multiple rounds support

---

## Exercise 6: API Monitoring Dashboard

**Objective:** Build monitoring tools for API health and usage.

**Task:** Create a monitoring script that:

- Checks API availability and response times
- Tracks success rates and error patterns
- Generates health reports
- Sends alerts for failures

---

## Exercise 7: Data Pipeline

**Objective:** Build a data processing pipeline using API data.

**Task:** Create a system that:

1. Collects data from both APIs over time
2. Processes and analyzes the data
3. Generates insights and reports
4. Exports data in multiple formats

---

## Self-Assessment

These advanced exercises prepare you for real-world API integration scenarios. Focus on:

- **Reliability**: Handle failures gracefully
- **Scalability**: Design for growth and load  
- **Maintainability**: Write clean, documented code
- **Security**: Implement proper error handling and logging
- **Performance**: Optimize for speed and efficiency
